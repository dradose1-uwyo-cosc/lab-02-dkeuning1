your_variable_here = "when you see this, replace it with your code"

## Section ONE

# Complete the following print statement to print out "Hello, COSC1010"
print("Hello, COSC1010")

# Assign the string above to a variable named hello_message and print that variable
hello_message = "Hello, COSC1010"
print(hello_message)

# Assign the string "cowboy joe" to a variable, and print that variable with title casing

joe_variable = "cowboy joe"

joe_variable = joe_variable.capitalize

print(joe_variable)

# Complete the following f-string print message 
    # You will need to create your own variables and insert them  
    # the final message should read `The University of Wyoming was founded in 1886`

variable1 = "University of Wyoming"
variable2 = 1886

print(f"The {variable1} was founded in {variable2}")

# Now let's do some math with variables 
    # Create two variables x and y and assign them the values 5 and 10 respectively 
x = 5
y = 10

    # Complete the following print statements using your variables
    #All math must be done within the braces in the f-strings
print(f"x + y = {your_variable_here}")
print(f"x - y = {your_variable_here}")
print(f"x * y = {your_variable_here}")
print(f"x / y = {your_variable_here}")

# String concatenation 
    # Finally we will take a look at string concatenation
    # String concatenation combines two strings together
    # It is done using the + operator
    # Create three variables:
        # first_name, which is your first name 
first_name = "Daniel"
        # last_name, which is your last name
last_name = "Keuning"
        # space, which is a space character 
space = " "
    # Use string concatenation to print out your full name 

print(first_name + space + last_name)
